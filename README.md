## 1.0 Charge and Electric field

### 1.1 Electric Charge
Electric charge is the property of subatomic particles that causes it to experience a force when placed in an elctric or magnetic field.

#### 1.1.1 Basic natures of charge
There are only two types of charge, which called positive and negative. Like charges repel, Unlike charges attract.

#### 1.1.2 Basic properties of charge
- **Charges are additive** - They are like scalars and can be added directly - `Q = q1 + q2 + q3 +...+ qn`
- **Charge is conserved quantity** - Charge can neither be created nor destroyed. But can be transferred from one body to another by certain methods like *Conduction, Induction, Friction*.
- **Quantization of charge** - Expressed as integral multiples (Measured using Coulombs) - `Q = ne`

#### 1.1.3 Electric Force
Electric force exists between charegs as described by coulomb's law.

**Coulomb's Law**

The electrical force between two charged objects is directly proportional to the product of the quantity of charge on the objects and inversely proportional to the square of the separation distance betweeb the two objects.

### 1.2 Electric Field
Electric force per unit charge. Electric field is radially outward from a positive point charge and radially in toward a negative point charge.

## 2.0 Gauss's law and applications

### 2.1 Electric Flux
Property of an electric field that may be thought of as the number of electric field lines that intersect a given area.

**Gauss's Law**

The total flux linked with a closed surface is `1/Îµ` times the charge enclosed by the closed surface.
